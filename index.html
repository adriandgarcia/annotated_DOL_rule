        <p class="ag-label">The Fiduciary Rule’s (Annotated) Executive Summary</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <p>
                The Department is issuing a final rule defining an investment advice fiduciary for purposes of Title I and Title II of ERISA. The final rule defines when a person is a fiduciary in connection with providing advice to an investor saving for retirement through a workplace retirement plan or other type of retirement plan such as an IRA. <span class='ag-highlight'>Such retirement investors include participants and beneficiaries in workplace retirement plans, IRA owners and beneficiaries, as well as plan and IRA fiduciaries with authority or control with respect to the plan or IRA.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='ag-annotation'>
            <p>The final summary text led with reference to IRA investors. The rule cites third-quarter 2023 data from the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> showing "IRAs held $13.0 trillion in assets, [while] private defined contribution plans held $8.4 trillion, and private defined benefit plans held $3.7 trillion in assets."
                <br> <br>IRA investors are "projected to move $4.5 trillion from defined contribution plans to IRAs from 2022 through 2027," according to Cerulli data.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class='ag-text'>
        <p class="ag-rule">
            Under the final rule, a person is an investment advice fiduciary if they provide a recommendation in one of the following contexts:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The person either directly or indirectly (e.g., through or together with any affiliate) makes <span class="ag-highlight">professional</span> investment recommendations to investors on a regular basis as part of their business and the recommendation is made <span class="ag-highlight">under circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable investor</span> in like circumstances that the recommendation:
                </li>
                <li>
                    is based on <span class="ag-highlight">review</span> of the retirement investor's particular needs or individual circumstances,
                </li>
                <li>
                    reflects <span class="ag-highlight">the application of professional or expert judgment</span> to the retirement investor's particular needs or individual circumstances, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    may be relied upon by the retirement investor as intended <span class="ag-highlight">to advance the retirement investor's best interest</span>; or
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The person represents or acknowledges that they are acting as a fiduciary under Title I of ERISA, Title II of ERISA, or both with respect to the recommendation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class='ag-annotation'>
            <p>The final rule removed the need for an advisor to have "discretionary authority or control" over "purchasing or selling securities or other investment property for the retirement investor." Instead, regulators opted to target those who make "professional" investment decisions.
                <br><br>The DOL also added language to cover how "a reasonable investor" may be receiving advice.
                <br><br>The final rule calls for a "review" of the investor's needs or circumstances.
                <br><br>Language related to an advisor's "judgment" was also added.
                <br><br>In the final rule, the recommendation no longer needs to be "a basis for investment decisions" but rather is intended to "advance" the investor's "best interest."
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <p>
                The recommendation also must be provided &ldquo;for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect&rdquo; as defined in the final rule.
            </p>

            <p>
                As compared to the previous regulatory definition, which was finalized in 1975, the final rule better reflects the text and the purposes of ERISA and better protects the interests of retirement investors, consistent with the Department's mission to ensure the security of the retirement, health, and other workplace-related benefits of America's workers and their families.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <p>
                The final rule is designed to ensure that retirement investors' reasonable expectations are honored when they receive advice from financial professionals who hold themselves out as trusted advice providers. The Department's regulation fills an important gap in those advice relationships where advice is not currently <span class="ag-highlight">treated as fiduciary advice under the 1975 regulation's approach to ERISA's functional fiduciary definition. This may be the case even though the financial professional holds themselves out as providing recommendations that are based on review of the retirement investor's needs or circumstances and the application of professional or expert judgment to the retirement investor's needs or circumstances, and that can be relied upon to advance the retirement investor's best interest.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='ag-annotation'>
            <p>The proposal contended that "advice is not currently required to be provided in the retirement investor's best interest, and the investor may not be aware of that fact."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <p>
                Together with amendments to administrative exemptions (PTEs) from the prohibited transaction rules applicable to fiduciaries under Title I and Title II of ERISA published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the final rule is intended to protect the interests of retirement investors by requiring persons who are defined in the final rule as investment advice fiduciaries to adhere to stringent conduct standards and mitigate their conflicts of interest. The amended PTEs' compliance obligations are generally consistent with the best interest obligations set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation Best Interest and its Commission Interpretation Regarding Standard of Conduct for Investment Advisers (SEC Investment Adviser Interpretation), each released in 2019.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <p>
                The Department anticipates that the most significant benefits of the final rule and amended PTEs will stem from the application of ERISA's fiduciary protections under Title I and Title II and PTE conditions to all covered investment advice provided to retirement investors. Under the final rule and amended PTEs, <span class="ag-highlight">advice providers that satisfy the definition of an investment advice fiduciary will be required to adhere to the prudence standard of care,</span> reduce retirement investor exposure to conflicted advice that may erode investment returns, and <span class="ag-highlight">adopt</span> protective conflict-mitigation requirements.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='ag-annotation'>
            <p>The proposal suggested that advisors would be subject to "a common fiduciary standard" that would reduce retirement investor exposure to conflicted advice. In the final rule, the standard was clarified to be "the prudence standard of care" and would apply to those advisors that meet "the definition of an investment advice fiduciary."</p>
            <p>Section 404 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act states that Title I plan fiduciaries must act with the “care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent [person] acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims,” and they also must discharge their duties with respect to a plan “solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.”</p>
            <p>The proposal said advisors would be "obligated to adhere" to protective conflict-mitigation requirements. The final rule states they must adopt those policies.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <p>
                Requiring advice providers to operate in compliance with ERISA fiduciary protections will be especially beneficial with respect to those transactions that currently are not uniformly covered by fiduciary protections consistent with ERISA's high standards. Those transactions include recommendations to roll over assets from a workplace retirement plan to an IRA in those cases in which the advice provider is not subject to Federal securities law standards and, as is often the case, <span class="ag-highlight">has not previously advised the customer about plan or IRA assets on a regular basis.</span> Other examples include investment recommendations with respect to many commonly purchased retirement annuities, such as fixed indexed annuities; <span class="ag-highlight">recommendations of other investments that may not be subject to the SEC's Regulation Best Interest, such as real estate, certain certificates of deposit, and other bank products; and investment recommendations to plan fiduciaries with authority or control with respect to the plan.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='ag-annotation'>
            <p>The proposal targeted those advisors who make rollover recommendations without having "an ongoing and preexisting relationship with the customer." The final language was tweaked to capture advisors who haven’t previously worked with clients on IRA assets or plans on a "regular basis."</p>
            <p>Regulators further spelled out in the final rule transactions that aren't "uniformly covered" by ERISA standards to include those also not subject to the SEC's Regulation Best Interest rules adopted in 2018.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="ag-text">
        <div class="ag-rule">
            <p><span class="ag-highlight">
                    A proposed rule and proposed amendments to the PTEs were released by the Department on October 31, 2023 for notice and public comment, and public hearings on the proposals were held on December 12 and 13, 2023. The Department has made certain changes and clarifications in the final rule in response to public comments on the proposal and the testimony presented at the public hearings. The final rule narrows the contexts in which a covered recommendation will constitute ERISA fiduciary investment advice and makes clear that the test for fiduciary status is objective. Similarly, a new paragraph in the regulatory text confirms that sales recommendations that do not satisfy the objective test will not be treated as fiduciary advice, and that the mere provision of investment information or education, without an investment recommendation, is not advice within the meaning of the rule. Additionally, the final rule makes clear that the rule is focused on communications with persons with authority over plan investment decisions (including selecting investment options for participant-directed plans), rather than communications with financial services providers who do not have such authority. Accordingly, the rule excludes plan and IRA investment advice fiduciaries from the definition of a retirement investor. As a result, an asset manager does not render fiduciary advice simply by making recommendations to a financial professional or firm that, in turn, will render advice to retirement investors in a fiduciary capacity. The Department believes the final rule, with these revisions, appropriately defines an investment advice fiduciary to comport with reasonable investor expectations of trust and confidence.</span>

        <div class='ag-annotation'>
            <p>The DOL received more than 400 individual comments and nearly 20,000 petition submissions as part of 14 separate petitions on the proposal.</p>
            <p>Although the rule was much changed from the proposal, the agency didn't "water down" the regulations, Lisa Gomez, assistant secretary of the DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration, told reporters.</p>
