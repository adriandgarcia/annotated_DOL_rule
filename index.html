        <p class="ag-label">Executive Summary</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The Department is issuing a final rule defining an investment advice fiduciary for purposes of Title I and Title II of ERISA. The final rule defines when a person is a fiduciary in connection with providing advice to an investor saving for retirement through a workplace retirement plan or other type of retirement plan such as an IRA. Such retirement investors include participants and beneficiaries in workplace retirement plans, IRA owners and beneficiaries, as well as plan and IRA fiduciaries with authority or control with respect to the plan or IRA.
        </p>
    </div>
        <p>
            Under the final rule, a person is an investment advice fiduciary if they provide a recommendation in one of the following contexts:
        </p>
        <p>
            The person either directly or indirectly (e.g., through or together with any affiliate) makes professional investment recommendations to investors on a regular basis as part of their business and the recommendation is made under circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable investor in like circumstances that the recommendation:
        </p>
        <p>
            is based on review of the retirement investor's particular needs or individual circumstances,
        </p>
        <p>
            reflects the application of professional or expert judgment to the retirement investor's particular needs or individual circumstances, and
        </p>
        <p>
            may be relied upon by the retirement investor as intended to advance the retirement investor's best interest; or
        </p>
        <p>
            The person represents or acknowledges that they are acting as a fiduciary under Title I of ERISA, Title II of ERISA, or both with respect to the recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The recommendation also must be provided &ldquo;for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect&rdquo; as defined in the final rule.
        </p>

        <p>
        As compared to the previous regulatory definition, which was finalized in 1975, the final rule better reflects the text and the purposes of ERISA and better protects the interests of retirement investors, consistent with the Department's mission to ensure the security of the retirement, health, and other workplace-related benefits of America's workers and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
        The final rule is designed to ensure that retirement investors' reasonable expectations are honored when they receive advice from financial professionals who hold themselves out as trusted advice providers. The Department's regulation fills an important gap in those advice relationships where advice is not currently treated as fiduciary advice under the 1975 regulation's approach to ERISA's functional fiduciary definition. This may be the case even though the financial professional holds themselves out as providing recommendations that are based on review of the retirement investor's needs or circumstances and the application of professional or expert judgment to the retirement investor's needs or circumstances, and that can be relied upon to advance the retirement investor's best interest.
        </p>
        <p>
        Together with amendments to administrative exemptions (PTEs) from the prohibited transaction rules applicable to fiduciaries under Title I and Title II of ERISA published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the final rule is intended to protect the interests of retirement investors by requiring persons who are defined in the final rule as investment advice fiduciaries to adhere to stringent conduct standards and mitigate their conflicts of interest. The amended PTEs' compliance obligations are generally consistent with the best interest obligations set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Regulation Best Interest and its Commission Interpretation Regarding Standard of Conduct for Investment Advisers (SEC Investment Adviser Interpretation), each released in 2019.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Department anticipates that the most significant benefits of the final rule and amended PTEs will stem from the application of ERISA's fiduciary protections under Title I and Title II and PTE conditions to all covered investment advice provided to retirement investors. Under the final rule and amended PTEs, advice providers that satisfy the definition of an investment advice fiduciary will be required to adhere to the prudence standard of care, reduce retirement investor exposure to conflicted advice that may erode investment returns, and adopt protective conflict-mitigation requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
        Requiring advice providers to operate in compliance with ERISA fiduciary protections will be especially beneficial with respect to those transactions that currently are not uniformly covered by fiduciary protections consistent with ERISA's high standards. Those transactions include recommendations to roll over assets from a workplace >retirement plan to an IRA in those cases in which the advice provider is not subject to Federal securities law standards and, as is often the case, has not previously advised the customer about plan or IRA assets on a regular basis. Other examples include investment recommendations with respect to many commonly purchased retirement annuities, such as fixed indexed annuities; recommendations of other investments that may not be subject to the SEC's Regulation Best Interest, such as real estate, certain certificates of deposit, and other bank products; and investment recommendations to plan fiduciaries with authority or control with respect to the plan.
        </p>

        <p>
        A proposed rule and proposed amendments to the PTEs were released by the Department on October 31, 2023 for notice and public comment, and public hearings on the proposals were held on December 12 and 13, 2023. The Department has made certain changes and clarifications in the final rule in response to public comments on the proposal and the testimony presented at the public hearings. The final rule narrows the contexts in which a covered recommendation will constitute ERISA fiduciary investment advice and makes clear that the test for fiduciary status is objective. Similarly, a new paragraph in the regulatory text confirms that sales recommendations that do not satisfy the objective test will not be treated as fiduciary advice, and that the mere provision of investment information or education, without an investment recommendation, is not advice within the meaning of the rule. Additionally, the final rule makes clear that the rule is focused on communications with persons with authority over plan investment decisions (including selecting investment options for participant-directed plans), rather than communications with financial services providers who do not have such authority. Accordingly, the rule excludes plan and IRA investment advice fiduciaries from the definition of a retirement investor. As a result, an asset manager does not render fiduciary advice simply by making recommendations to a financial professional or firm that, in turn, will render advice to retirement investors in a fiduciary capacity. The Department believes the final rule, with these revisions, appropriately defines an investment advice fiduciary to comport with reasonable investor expectations of trust and confidence.
